******** FINISHED calling significant interactions
ERROR !!!!!!!! FitHiChIP could not compute the statistical significance of input interactions
Check the input parameters, or check if the number of input nonzero contact locus pairs are too few !!!
If you are using peak to peak background only (UseP2PBackgrnd=1 or stringent background), check the number of nonzero peak-to-peak locus pairs (peak-to-peak) !!! In such a case, you should go for loose background (UseP2PBackgrnd=0) for modeling interaction significance!!! Specially, if the sequencing depth of your data is very low....
